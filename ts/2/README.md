Things to know when programming in JavaScript:

* = assign
* == comparison
* result.num1 for result of num1
* Number.parseInt(result.num1) to CONVERT a number to a string
* variable = var - you only need to use this the first time you are declaring a variable, after this you can just write your variable without using var, example: First time: var y = ayu  Next time(s): y = sh
* console.log() = TERMINAL
* () - parenthesis - this is used to pass parameters to a function
* [] - square brackets - this usually denotes an array. An array is a set of things
* {} - curly braces - start and end of a function or an object
* ; - semi colon - this usually denotes the end of a line
* . - period - this denotes a function. It also denotes a property of an object. If it is a function it will have parenthesis (9), otherwise it is a property of an object
* , - comma - it is a separator or a delimiter of things
* Troubleshooting: write on a piece of paper what the computer is thinking, don't use the variable names, use the numbers the computer is using, write pseudocode (20)
* function - 
* "" - The computer will not try to interpret anything inside the double quotes and will make it a string
* if ()  {} - put what your if is inside the parenthisis (9), and put what you want to happen in the curly braces
* else if () {} - you will put what you want to happen if the if isn't true (else if works the same as an if (18))
* Pseudocode - You write on a piece of paper a mix of code and human language (looks like code, but won't actually work)
* String - a character or characters (everything you type in the computer will be a string, even if you type a number) Example: String: 56 + 63 = 5663 Number: 56 + 63 = 119, to convert a string to a number, see Number.ParseInt (6)
